# DOMAIN-based Rules for Surge 4 & Quantumult X

These rule sets include domain-based rules for Surge & Quantumult X, exclusively provide logical rules (AND, NOT) for Surge 4.

## How to use?

See [Create your own Surge Module](https://github.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist#create-your-own-surge-module)

## Fix Apple-System-Apps Installation Error

Enabling [iOS OTA update blocker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/master/DOMAINs/AppleOTA.list) will also blocks the installations of some Apple-Apps such as Weather, Home, Mail. 

### [Solution 1]
Add ```USER-AGENT,MobileAsset*,DIRECT``` on top of **AppleOTA.list** on your Surge Module or configuration. This method is yet to be tested and may not work on Quantumult X due to rules loading priority ([V2EX Discussion #62](https://www.v2ex.com/t/642077)).

### [Solution 2]
Block iOS system update package downloading only, while update information can still be displayed without showing the badge on Setting app. [AppleOTA.list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/master/DOMAINs/AppleOTA.list) is unnecessary in this solution. It has been tested on an iOS 12 device with Surge 4. MITM is required. Surge Module Example is [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TPCTPCTPC/surgemodule-examples/main/iOS-OTA-Blocker.sgmodule).

```
URL-REGEX,^https:\/\/mesu\.apple\.com\/assets\/com_apple_MobileAsset_SoftwareUpdate\/,REJECT

URL-REGEX,^http:\/\/updates-http\.cdn-apple\.com\/.+\/com_apple_MobileAsset_SoftwareUpdate\/,REJECT

hostname = mesu.apple.com
```

## These rules do not support *Quantumult X*, load them with js parser.
```Zhihu.list```

## Netease Music rules are deleted
This set is considered too risky to use. I found it blocked too many functions and elements, such as editing profile and commenting. Works fine without this set in one year testing, so I delete it.

## Modules

### Clear WeChat
Inspired by [ahhhhfs](https://twitter.com/abskoop?s=21&t=esRqUThzMpyQA1ZRbCUaLQ), collected by myself. Works fine for over 2 years(except for the newly added referer removing), please go to issues if you've found errors. Cheers.

### YouTube Tweaks
Blocking Trackers & unlock PiP on YouTube. If you are looking for YT Adblocker, I recommend [Maasea's](https://github.com/Maasea/sgmodule/raw/master/YoutubeAds.sgmodule).

### Do-Not-Sneek DNS
I found Netflix keeps looking up 8.8.8.8 when playing, so I block it.

### Do-Not-Track My Xiaohongshu
It collects my personal data all the time, so I block it.

### Don't Be Evil, Apple Inc.
Who'd thought? Apple steals privacy, too. Great work by [Hagezi](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists#native-tracker---broadband-tracker-of-devices-and-operating-systems), this link also includes Microsoft and Huawei's native tracker list. Check out if you are interested!
